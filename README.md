# Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This repo contains Python code and notes I created while learning various python programming concepts. Each topic is organized into its own folder with code examples and a dedicated README file containing detailed notes. This repository serves as a personal reference and a resource for others on the same path.

## Repository Structure

- **/topic-name/**: Each folder represents a Python topic (e.g., `variables`, `loops`, `functions`).
  - `code.py`: Python script(s) with example code for the topic.
  - `README.md`: Notes explaining the topic, including concepts, examples, and key takeaways.
- **README.md** (this file): Overview of the repository and its contents.

## Topics Covered

Below is a list of topics included in this repository (this section will be updated as new topics are added):

- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding basic data types (int, float, string, boolean) and variable assignment.
- **Control Flow**: Using if-else statements, loops (for, while), and conditional logic.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, parameters, return statements, and scope.
- **Lists and Dictionaries**: Working with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **Modules and Packages**: Importing and using Python modules and creating custom modules.
- **Error Handling**: Using try-except blocks to handle exceptions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **More topics to be added as I progress!**
